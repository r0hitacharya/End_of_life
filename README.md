# Hardware Lifecycle Information Extractor

## Description
This repository contains scripts for automatically extracting hardware lifecycle information (End of Life, End of Support, End of Maintenance, etc.) from various vendors, starting with Juniper Riverbed. More vendors will be added soon. 

## Use Cases
- **Automating Sales Cycles**: The extracted data enables quicker identification of sales opportunities, particularly for hardware approaching or at their End of Life.
  
- **Renewal Conversations**: Engage clients in conversations about renewing hardware contracts, thus improving customer retention.
  
- **Upsell and Cross-sell**: Create opportunities for upselling and cross-selling based on the lifecycle data.
  
- **Support Contracts for EOL Hardware**: Allows companies to establish support contracts for end-of-life equipment, provided they have spares.
  
- **Whitespace Analysis**: Understand the whitespace within a client's environment to offer targeted solutions.
  
- **Latest Updates**: Stay up-to-date on the latest hardware and software updates from vendors.

## Additional Benefits
- **Cost Optimization**: Make well-informed decisions to optimize hardware-related costs.
  
- **Compliance**: Helps in maintaining compliance by keeping hardware and software up-to-date.
  
- **Strategic Planning**: Assists in long-term IT planning by providing a clear picture of hardware lifecycle stages.
